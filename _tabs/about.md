Hello! Welcome to my blog. I am Kazi hossain currently a undergraduate studying Computer Science & Mathematics. If you can't tell by already I am obsessed with space. Within the pages of this blog, I share my musings on a diverse range of topics, including but not limited to, technology, aerospace, physics, mathematics, and more. Additionally, I occasionally delve into literature and lifestyle.
