Hello! Welcome to my blog. I am Kazi Hossain, currently an undergraduate student studying Computer Science & Mathematics. If you can't tell already, I am obsessed with space. Within the pages of this blog, I share my musings on a diverse range of topics, including but not limited to technology, aerospace, physics, engineering, school, mathematics, and more. Additionally, I occasionally delve into literature and lifestyle.


Thanks for stopping by!
